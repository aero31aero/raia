# Srimanta Barua

Hello. I am a third-year undergraduate student, majoring in Computer Science. Since I'm in CRUx, I guess you can say I'm a coder. I'm one of those people who's always trying to figure out how things work from the ground up. I love the simplicity of C and Assembly (currently only x86/x86_64). I appreciate the succinctness of Python and use it for prototyping etc. And as of now I'm learning Rust and plan to switch to it completely once the language comes of age.

## Projects

### Decentralized Chat (C++)

I'm working on the C++ version of CRUx's idea for a decentralized chat service. The concept here is that the service continues to function without interruption even when the initial server is disconnected. This project is written in C++ and the [Qt framework](https://www.qt.io/), and the source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/CRUx-BPHC/DecentralizedChat).

### ShuOS

This is a small personal project that I'm working on, which is basically writing a hobby operating system - kernel and all - from scratch. The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/SrimantaBarua/ShuOS). Currently I'm working on refactoring the code and making it more modular, so that in the future, multiple architectures, memory allocators, etc. can be added as 'plugins' of sorts, which are then compiled based on compile-time options.

I'd welcome anyone who wants to learn about OSDev / slightly advanced C / assembly, to start contributing to this project. I've tried to document every step and also to fill the code with comments, in the hope that it would help anyone who stumbles down this path in the future.
