# Naren Surampudi

I am a 2016 Batch Undergrad Student of BPHC majoring in Electronics & Communication and also a coder. I love to code in Python and sometimes even code in Java.

## Projects

### Video & Audio Downloader

This project aims to define a new way of getting your hands on the videos and audios you love. Use this to download videos from YouTube. If you want only the audio, you can use this to rip it off the video.

Source Code is on [Github](https://github.com/nsurampu/Video-Audio_Downloader). This is a solo project and am still thinking of ways to expand it's functionality.

### File Locker

This project aims to grant privacy to the user, to a limited extent. This can be used to lock pdf files and encrypt txt files using AES encryption.

Source Code is on [Github](https://github.com/nsurampu/File_locker). This is a solo project and I plan on expanding it to other file types as well.
